# csv-to-csv
This Python script... 
- reads a CSV file containing address locations for over 6,000 Starbucks locations across 36 states
- creates a dictionary with states as key values and the number of Starbucks in the state as pair values
- writes this dictionary to a new CSV file
The resulting CSV was then joined to US state shapefile. The states were symbolized using a graduated color scheme under the Jenks Natural Breaks distribution method.
